# Library installation
```bash
pip instal customtkinter pillow
```

# Instructions
First, create a folder containing layers (body, eyes, shirts, pants) and put all the layer element images (maintaining the positioning well because it can't intelligently determine where it will be placed). Make sure that the image element sizes are the same. Otherwise, it won't work well. Then load the folder in the software interface, and then drag and drop it to put the bottom later at the bottom and top layer at the top layer. Then enter the number of images to generate and press generate, and sit back. It will create the image for you.
